### Build & Test job

> Build and test application on all commits

Create a [Github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (with `repo` and `workflow` permissions) and add it as a `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret in your repo


### **Deploy** job

> Manual deploy to Github Pages (only main branch)

- Replace `base` config in `vite.config.ts` to match your repo name
- Create `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` secrets in your repo (it will be the author of commits to `gh-pages` branch)
